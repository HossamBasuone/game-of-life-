# 🧬 Game of Life  

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project simulates a cellular automaton where cells evolve based on predefined rules.  

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Interactive grid** – Click to toggle cells on or off.  
✅ **Start/Pause simulation** – Control the evolution of cells.  
✅ **Customizable speed** – Adjust the simulation speed.  
✅ **Responsive design** – Works on different screen sizes.  

## 🌍 Live Demo  
🚀 [View the Game of Life in action](https://hossambasuone.github.io/game-of-life-/)  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** – Structure of the page  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic for the simulation  

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HossamBasuone/game-of-life-.git
cd game-of-life-
```  

2️⃣ **Open the project**  
Simply open `index.html` in your browser.  

## 📝 How It Works  

1️⃣ Click on the grid to activate/deactivate cells.  
2️⃣ Press the **Start** button to begin the simulation.  
3️⃣ Cells will evolve based on these rules:  
   - A **live cell** with **fewer than 2** or **more than 3** neighbors dies.  
   - A **dead cell** with **exactly 3** neighbors becomes alive.  
4️⃣ Pause or restart the simulation at any time.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  

🔹 Add grid resizing options.  
🔹 Save and load patterns.  
🔹 Improve performance for larger grids.
